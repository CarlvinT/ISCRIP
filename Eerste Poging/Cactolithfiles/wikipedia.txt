Geology is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.
Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any celestial body (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).
    
Geology gives insight into the history of the Earth by providing the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and past climates.
Geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental problems, and for providing insights into past climate change.
Geology also plays a role in geotechnical engineering and is a major academic discipline.
